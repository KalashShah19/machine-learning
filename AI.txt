AI
    Area of computer science that emphasis the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans
    is capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour

Deep Learning
    Uses NN to solve complex problems 
    It mimics the way our brain functions ie it learns from past experiences

How Deep Learning Works?
    Deep Learning studies the basic unit of a brain called a brain cell or a neuron. Inspired from a neuron, an artificial neuron or a perceptron was developed.
    A biological neuron, has dendrites which is used to receive inputs. Similarly, a perceptron receives multiple inputs, applies various transformations and functions and provides an output.
    Our brain consists of multiple connected neurons called neural network, we can also have a network of artificial neurons called perceptron's to form a Deep neural network.
