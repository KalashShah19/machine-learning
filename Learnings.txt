Process of Machine Learning:
    Data Collection
    Data Preprocessing
    Model Selection
    Train Model
    Testing and Evolution
    Predictions
    Production
    Update and Maintain

Metrics to Evaluate Machine Learning Algorithm
    ROC AOC Curve
    Accuracy
    Precision
    F1 Score
    Confusion Matrix
    Mean Absolute Error
    R Squared

Deep Learning 
    It is to make a NN model that approximates a function, func is assumed to fit the given data to us and it will predict the incoming data points.
    NN is a very complex function which is impossible to imagine and it can approximate a lot of data points

Training
    We feed data with it again and again to minimize the error this process is called training.

Types of Neural Networks
    Feed Forward NN
    Backward Propagation NN
    Convolutional NN
    Reccuring NN
    LSTMs - long short term memory neural networks these are made to solve longer sequences and vanishing gradient problems.
    Auto Encoders
    GANs Generative Adversarial Networks - advanced than LSTMs
    Transformers - NN to train data on NLP
